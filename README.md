## ⚙️ Environment Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or pnpm package manager
- Google Cloud Platform account
- Google Spreadsheet

### 2. Create Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
# Google Sheets API credentials
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
```

### 3. Google Cloud Setup

#### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one

#### Step 2: Enable APIs
Enable the following APIs:
- **Google Sheets API**
- **Google Drive API** (for Apps Script features)

#### Step 3: Create Service Account
1. Navigate to **IAM & Admin** → **Service Accounts**
2. Click **Create Service Account**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "team-activity-logger")
4. Click **Create and Continue**
5. Skip granting roles (optional)
6. Click **Done**

#### Step 4: Generate Service Account Key
1. Click on the created service account
2. Go to **Keys** tab
3. Click **Add Key** → **Create New Key**
4. Select **JSON** format
5. Click **Create** (JSON file will download)

#### Step 5: Extract Credentials
Open the downloaded JSON file and copy:
- `client_email` → Use as `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`
- `private_key` → Use as `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` (keep the `\n` characters)

### 4. Google Sheets Setup

#### Step 1: Create a Spreadsheet
1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/)
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. Note the Spreadsheet ID from the URL:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit
   ```

#### Step 2: Share with Service Account
1. Click **Share** button
2. Paste the service account email (from `client_email`)
3. Grant **Editor** access (required for adding activities, members, and activity types)
   > ⚠️ **Note**: Editor access is necessary because the application creates sheets and appends data. For read-only operations, Viewer access would suffice.
4. Uncheck "Notify people"
5. Click **Share**

#### Step 3: Sheet Structure
The application will automatically create three sheets:
- **Members**: Stores team member information
- **ActivityTypes**: Stores activity categories
- **Activities**: Stores all logged activities
